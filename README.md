# FRONT-END DESIGN
# Front-end web development details
 HTML : Provides the foundational structure of web pages, essential for all web 
professionals and the starting point for web content creation.

 CSS : Controls presentation, formatting, and layout of HTML elements, 
enhancing the visual appearance of websites.

 JAVASCRIPT : Controls the behavior of elements on web pages, adding interactivity 
and complexity to site functionality.

HTML:

HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number 
of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the 
starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily 
for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn. 

CSS:

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how 
the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the 
page. 

JavaScript:

JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't 
released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern 
web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and 
complex functionality.
